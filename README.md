# The-Foodie-Guide
We created this project as a tool to search for the best places to eat locally -restaurants, pubs and bars. What makes us different from the most popular reviews websites is that here you can find nutritional information and accurate and updated prices. Find the most variate and complete list of places, togheather with the exact location in just one place! 

# Usage
Simply fill in the area where you are in the search bar and a list of the best restaurants will appear. You can add more filters such as type of food and opening hours.
